**RE: Confirmation of System Requirements - Web-Based Order, Inventory and Production Tracking System**

Dear [Client Contact Person Name],

We are writing to formally confirm that the **Web-Based Order, Inventory and Production Tracking System** developed for Unick Enterprises Inc. has been completed in accordance with your specified requirements. This letter serves as documentation of the system functions and processes that have been implemented, and we request your formal confirmation that these meet your business needs.

The system has been designed to manage three core operational areas: Order Management, Inventory Management, and Production Tracking. Below is a detailed listing of all confirmed functions and features.

**ORDER MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS:**

The system includes complete order management capabilities. Customers can browse the product catalog, view product details including images and prices, add items to a shopping cart, and place orders. The system generates unique order numbers automatically. For Made-to-Order products, the system enforces a fixed quantity of one (1) per order. For stocked products, customers can select quantities based on available inventory.

Administrators can review all incoming orders, accept or reject them, and manage order statuses through the workflow: Pending → Accepted → Processing → Completed → Delivered. The system provides real-time order status updates and sends notifications to customers when order statuses change. Order history is maintained for both customers and administrators.

**INVENTORY MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS:**

The inventory management module provides real-time tracking of all materials and finished goods. The system automatically deducts materials from inventory when production occurs, based on the Bill of Materials (BOM) for each product. Material consumption is calculated and logged automatically.

The system includes an alert system that notifies administrators when materials fall below specified thresholds. It calculates "days left" for each material based on consumption rates and provides replenishment schedule recommendations. The system includes forecasting capabilities that predict material consumption for 7, 14, and 30-day periods.

Inventory reports are available in multiple formats, including inventory status reports, material usage reports, and replenishment schedule reports. All reports can be exported to CSV or PDF formats.

**PRODUCTION TRACKING FUNCTIONS:**

The production tracking module handles two types of production: Alkansya Daily Production and Made-to-Order Production.

For Alkansya products, the system allows staff to record daily production output, including the quantity produced and which staff member produced it. The system automatically deducts materials from inventory based on the product's BOM when production is recorded. Historical production data is maintained (defaulting to the last 3 months) and daily production statistics are calculated automatically.

For Made-to-Order products, the system automatically creates a production order when an order is accepted. Production stages are tracked: Not Started, In Progress, and Completed. The system calculates production progress as a percentage and tracks a 14-day production deadline from the date of order acceptance. Staff can update production stages, and the system provides production timeline visualization.

The Work Progress Tracking feature provides a comprehensive overview showing all products with their current status, progress percentages, completion quantities, and last update information. The system includes search functionality to find products by name or order number, and filtering options by product type (All/Alkansya/Made-to-Order) and status (All/Not Started/In Progress/Completed).

**PRODUCTION REPORTS:**

The system includes nine types of production reports: Production Overview, Production Performance, Work Progress, Production Output Analytics, Made-to-Order Reports, Alkansya Output Reports, Efficiency Metrics, Resource Utilization, and Production Stage Breakdown. All reports can be exported to CSV or PDF formats, include preview functionality before download, and support customizable date ranges. Summary cards display key metrics for quick reference.

**USER MANAGEMENT:**

The system includes three user roles: Admin (full system access), Staff (production and inventory management access), and Customer (order placement and tracking access). User authentication is secure with login/logout functionality, role-based access control, secure password management, and session management.

**PRODUCT CATALOG:**

Products are organized into two categories: Stocked Products (Alkansya) and Made-to-Order Products. Each product includes name, code, category, price, description, and images. Stock levels are tracked for stocked products, and availability status is managed for made-to-order products.

**BILL OF MATERIALS (BOM):**

The system includes BOM management where each product can have a BOM created and edited. Material requirements are specified with quantities per product. The system automatically calculates material needs during production and BOM data can be exported.

**CONFIRMED BUSINESS PROCESSES:**

The order processing workflow operates as follows: (1) Customer browses catalog and places order, (2) System generates order number, (3) Admin reviews order, (4) Admin accepts or rejects order, (5) For accepted orders, production orders are created automatically for MTO items or inventory is reserved for stocked items, (6) Production stages are tracked and updated, (7) Materials are automatically deducted based on BOM, (8) Production completion updates order status, (9) Order is marked ready for delivery, (10) Delivery is confirmed.

The Alkansya production workflow: (1) Staff records daily production output, (2) System automatically deducts materials from inventory based on BOM, (3) Production statistics updated in real-time, (4) Daily production data stored for reporting, (5) Reports generated for management review.

The inventory management process: (1) Materials tracked in real-time, (2) Consumption calculated automatically from production, (3) Low stock alerts generated when thresholds reached, (4) Replenishment schedules provided based on forecasting, (5) Predictive analytics anticipate future material needs.

**TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:**

The system has been developed using React.js with Bootstrap 5 for the frontend, Laravel PHP Framework for the backend, MySQL database, RESTful API architecture, token-based authentication (JWT), and responsive design compatible with desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

**SYSTEM BENEFITS:**

The system provides improved efficiency through automated processes, real-time visibility of orders/inventory/production, better decision-making through comprehensive reports and analytics, cost control through optimized inventory management, enhanced customer service through better order tracking, and scalability to grow with business needs.
